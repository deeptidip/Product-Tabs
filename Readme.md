# Coding Assessment L-2 Code Submission

# Product Tabs Project

## Overview:

The Product Tabs project is a web application designed to showcase and categorize products for men, women, and kids. Users can easily navigate through different product categories using tabs and view a curated selection of items in each category. The project emphasizes a responsive design, providing an optimal user experience on various screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

## Features:

`Tab Navigation`: Users can select product categories (Men, Women, Kids) through interactive tabs, triggering the display of relevant products.
`Responsive Design`: The project adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing experience on both mobile devices and larger screens.
`Product Showcase`: Each product is presented in a visually appealing card format, featuring images, titles, vendor information, prices, and additional details.
`Dynamic Data Fetching`: Product information is fetched from an external source (a JSON file in this case) to dynamically update the displayed products based on the selected category.
